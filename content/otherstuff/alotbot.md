Hey! Here's the (unofficial) reference for [SN4T14's AlotBot](http://github.com/SN4T14/AlotBot), the resident IRC bot of #DataHoarder on Freenode.  AlotBot was originally meant to be a joke, to provide tongue-in-cheek corrections when users typed "alot" and meant "a lot". From there, it spiralled out into the wonderfully useful tool you use today.

*Note: [Testing this bot was real fun](http://i.imgur.com/crsoi5U.png).*
