I've been a linux user for almost 10 years: I started in 2005 with Ubuntu 4.10, and shortly after that Ubuntu 5.04 which I experimented with for a few months. Then I distro-hopped for a while, running everything from [Damn Small Linux](http://www.damnsmalllinux.org) to [Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.org/main/Overview%20and%20Getting%20Started.htm) to [~Mandrake Linux~~ Mandriva](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mandriva) (I spent *a lot* on blank CDs).
